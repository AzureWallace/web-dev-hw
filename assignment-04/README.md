13. I looked up Amazons' website to see what their website looked throughout history. The website's background was white based with all the tabs on the left hand side of the website instead of on a tab bar up top. Their are some pictures of products but not as many as you will usually see on Amazon's current website.
14. I learned how to add images in and how to use preformatted text. Something that was harder for me was the link aspect of the module. I found this part really hard to had to find help to complete it.
