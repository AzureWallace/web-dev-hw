13. System font are fonts that are already installed on your local device and system. Web fonts are custom fonts hosted on a server and web-safe fonts are fonts that are known across the web this reduces load times and may increase performance.
14. The importance of having fallback fonts is to ensure the font in case their is a failure. If the original font is unsuccessful in loading or is taking too long it is best practice to have a fallback that is similar to the original font.
15. For this assignment I first tried to decide which what publication I wanted to choose and then from that I decided to choose a blue background because Scotlands' flag color is blue. I then decided on which fonts were best for the project and went from there. I chose my fonts from Google Fonts.
