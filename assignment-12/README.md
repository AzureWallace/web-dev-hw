13. My imaginary client was a small business photography company who wanted to build a website to further their clientele base. Their website needs were that they wanted to show some of their photos that they have taken along with a map of some of the locations. They also wanted an about page to tell the users about who the photographers are.
14. Display: Block is used to create vertical menus out of lists. Display: inline forces only take up as much horizontal space as is needed and Display: inline-block removes new lines inherent in block elements and also forces elements to respect margin and vertical spacing properties.
15. For this work cycle I looked back to the previous assignment to help me format the website and think about what I want for the website and the layout and tabs for the website. I also went back and looked at previous assignments to help me as well. Looking into the book to reference some events that I had forgotten.
