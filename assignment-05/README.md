<<<<<<< HEAD
13.You should only have one main <head> and <body> elements and all the information to be displayed on the website will be coded in between these two elements for a page. The head is formatting the website to look a certain way while the body is the information that is going to be displayed on the website.
14. Structural markup is what embeds the information about the structure of the document. It formats the headings, paragraphs, breaks and lists. Semantic markup is the citations, quotations, links, abbreviations and editorial changes. The styling of the information.
15. My work cycle for this assignment started with me creating all the correct documents and folders that I need. Then I read the chapter on your website and followed along with the homework and if I got stuck I would then go and view the walkthrough to see if I was doing anything wrong. Usually every time I finish a part of the homework assignment I will refresh my webpage and make sure that everything looks how it should and is functioning properly.
