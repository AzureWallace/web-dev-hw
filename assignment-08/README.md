13. I really didn't know anything about HTML before taking this class other than that it is used to create websites. I have friends who had experience in HTML and they said that the syntax is relatively easy especially if you have had any experience in coding. I have experience in coding in Visual Basic so what was new to me was the syntax for one like the 4 main headings and that when creating a paragraph you have to do a <p> for each line or there's other ways around that. Overall, HTML is pretty easy to learn but there is a lot of syntax to learn and it can be difficult to remember some of the smaller details.
14. I have no experience in CSS at all so I am excited to just learn more about CSS and learn how to apply it to my website.
15. For this assignment I relied on my experience from past assignments to help start the assignment and then when I got stuck or forget something I would look on my other assignments to remind me of what I had to do in order for the website to function properly.
