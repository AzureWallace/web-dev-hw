          <h1>How to Folf</h1>
    <li> The first thing that you need to Folf is a folfing disc. Discs are found at most sports stores.</li></br>
    <li>You go to a folf course of your choosing. If you don't know of any nearby folf courses there are many sites that detail where folf courses are.</br>
      I personally love the Blue Mountain Folf course in Missoula, Montana.</li></br>

    <div id="hole" class="container">
    <li>When you arrive at the Folf course, if there is a map of the course I reccommend viewing the map to see where the first hole is.</br>
      With that being said find the first hole which should be marked with a number.</li></br>

    <div id="throw" class="container">
      <li>Once you have reached the first hole, you and the other members will take turns throwing a disc.</br>The best way to throw the disc is by keeping the disc flat and using your wrist to aim at the hole.</br></li>

      <li>After each player has gone, the player that is farthest from the hole will go first and then the next farthest and so on.</li></br>
      <li>You will count the number of throws it took for you to get in the hole. The person with the lowest number of throws is the winner</li></br>
      <li>After the first hole, you will continue to the next hole and start the process over again until you reach the end of the folf course.</li></br>
