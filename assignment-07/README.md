13.  Divs are used to group elements together instead of doing it one by one. The id attribute takes a string as a unique identifier to that specific element. The id attribute is the label for the divs. The class attribute is used inside the div to group together similar types of elements together by using the same name value. Span is very similar to divs but instead of grouping elements together spans group content together that requires organization or extra styling.
14. Alt text is used to describe an image for people who are visually impaired. This text briefly describes what the image looks like so the user can get an idea of the image that is represented.
15. My work cycle for this assignment involved me working on each part individually and test trying it. I started with the image section first because we have uploaded images in other homework assignments, so I knew I could do it. After I got that completed I tried to set up the audio and was test trying it to make sure it worked then I kept going down the line until the website was created.
