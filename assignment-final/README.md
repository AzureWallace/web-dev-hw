13. I learned a lot of new things using GitHub was something that I had never used before but I found it to be fairly easily. The thing I learned most during this course was of course learning how to code in HTML and CSS. When I started this class I had no idea what CSS was or how it related to HTML at all but now I can know how they work together and what the difference is between the two.
14. I learned a lot but I think the thing that took me the longest to learn and figure out was how to do menu bars, divs and Ids didn't completely make sense to me at first but now I feel that I know what I'm doing when I used divs.
15. My workcycle for this started with me trying to get everything done that I knew what I wanted and then work on the CSS. I tested numerous times during this assignment pretty much anytime I changed anything in CSS I would then check to make sure that everything worked out. Things that I couldn't remember or was having a hard time getting it to work exactly how I wanted, I would go to earlier assignments and look at the code that could help me.
