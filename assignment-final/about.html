      <p>My name is Azure Wallace and I live in Missoula, Mt. Once the Springtime hits me and my friends take any chance we can get to go to a Disc Golf Course and enjoy the sunshine and wilderness. Disc Golf is an activity that is great for exercise and a way to pass time. I have many friends that have never folfed before and when I take them to a course they are blown away at how much fun they actually had.</p>
      <p>The reason that I created this website is because there are so many disc golf courses in Montana that people don't know about, myself included. Therefore, I wanted to create a website that was informative for fellow folfers and people who are just interested in learning more about disc golf (folfing). I hope that you enjoy this website and if I am missing anything please let me know in the Contact Us page.</P>
        <h2>Enjoy your Folfing Adventures!</h2>
