I decided to take this class because web design has been something that always interested me. I've created simple websites using sources like Wix or Wordpress but I am interested in the behind the scenes aspect of creating a web site. Knowing the right language to use and understanding how to properly create a functioning website. I hope to use these skills late on in my life by creating a website for either myself, family member or other people.


1. How to best format a website
2. Creating full functionality and ease of accessibility
3. Maintaing and updating the website properly without causing error to website
