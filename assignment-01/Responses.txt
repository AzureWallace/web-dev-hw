How is the web different than the Internet?
  The internet is what connects the device you are using to the other device/server that you are trying to reach while the    web is the platform on which you are searching on. For example when I get online to check my Moodle page the Internet is what connects my computer to the school's server and the platform (google, explorer, firefox, etc) is the web.
Briefly describe how the internet works.
  A user will go onto the Internet and when this happens their network becomes linked with the Internet and then when you search for a webpage the Internet connects to the webpages network to connect the user to the webpage.
